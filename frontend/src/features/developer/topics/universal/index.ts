// Practice Platform: LeetCode, HackerRank, and FrontendExpert.io
// Mock Interviews: Use Pramp, Interviewing.io to simulate pressure.
// Target Pattern Recognition: Many companies repeat similar problem types.

// Event Loops and all
// JavaScript handles asynchronous operations using several mechanisms that allow non-blocking behavior—this is essential because JavaScript is single-threaded, and blocking operations (like waiting for a server response) would freeze the whole program.
// Here’s a breakdown of how JS executes asynchronous operations:

// 🧠 1. Event Loop Model
// At the core of async behavior in JavaScript is the event loop. JS runs in a single-threaded environment (the main thread), and it uses the event loop to manage asynchronous tasks.

// How it works:
// The main thread executes code synchronously.
// Asynchronous tasks (like setTimeout, fetch, or I/O operations) are handed off to the Web APIs (in browsers) or libuv (in Node.js).
// When the async operation completes, a callback is queued in the callback queue (also called the task queue or message queue).
// The event loop pushes these callbacks into the call stack only when the stack is empty.

// 🧰 2. Mechanisms for Asynchronous Execution
// ✅ Callbacks
// The old way of handling async operations.

// javascript
// Copy
// Edit
// setTimeout(() => {
//   console.log("Executed after 1 second");
// }, 1000);
// ✅ Promises
// A modern way to handle async code, improving readability and chaining.

// javascript
// Copy
// Edit
// fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
//   .then(response => response.json())
//   .then(data => console.log(data))
//   .catch(error => console.error(error));
// ✅ Async/Await
// Syntactic sugar over Promises, making async code look synchronous.

// javascript
// Copy
// Edit
// async function getData() {
//   try {
//     const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
//     const data = await response.json();
//     console.log(data);
//   } catch (err) {
//     console.error(err);
//   }
// }

// 🕒 3. Task Queues
// JavaScript differentiates between macro-tasks and micro-tasks.
// Macro-tasks: setTimeout, setInterval, setImmediate, I/O
// Micro-tasks: Promises (.then, .catch), queueMicrotask, MutationObserver
// Event loop order:
// Executes all micro-tasks after the current call stack is empty.
// Then, executes one macro-task.
// Repeats the cycle.

// 🔁 Execution Flow Example
// javascript
// Copy
// Edit
// console.log('Start');

// setTimeout(() => console.log('Timeout'), 0);

// Promise.resolve().then(() => console.log('Promise'));

// console.log('End');
// Output:

// sql
// Copy
// Edit
// Start
// End
// Promise
// Timeout
// Explanation:

// Synchronous code: Start, End
// Microtask: Promise (runs before macro-tasks)
// Macrotask: Timeout

// ┌───────────────────────────────────┐
// │               Call Stack          │
// └───────────────────────────────────┘
//                  ▲      ▲
//                  │      │
//          ┌───────┘      └───────┐
//          │                      │
// ┌────────┴──────┐     ┌─────────┴───────┐
// │   Microtasks  │     │   Macrotasks    │
// │(Promises, etc)│     │(setTimeout, etc)│
// └───────────────┘     └─────────────────┘
//          ▲                      ▲
//          │                      │
// ┌────────┴──────────────────────┴───┐
// │         Event Loop                │
// └───────────────────────────────────┘

// 🔁 How It Works in Action:
// JS runs all synchronous code on the call stack.
// When async functions are encountered:
// Timers and I/O are passed to Web APIs (or Node.js internals).
// Promises go into the microtask queue.
// When the call stack is empty:
// The event loop first flushes all microtasks.
// Then it executes one macrotask (e.g., setTimeout), and repeats.

// 🥡 Real-World Analogy: Restaurant
// Imagine JavaScript is a single chef in a kitchen:
// The chef (JS engine) can only cook one dish at a time (single-threaded).
// When a customer places a complex order (like baking a cake), the chef doesn't wait for it.
// He tells the oven (Web API) to bake it and sets a timer (like setTimeout).
// Meanwhile, the chef continues working on other orders (synchronous code).
// When the oven is done, it puts a sticky note (callback) on the counter (task queue).
// The chef checks the counter only after he's done with current tasks (when the call stack is empty).

// 🍰 Bonus twist: Promises are urgent notes that the chef checks before anything else, even before macrotasks.
